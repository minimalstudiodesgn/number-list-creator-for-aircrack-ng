Writes number lists and splits them in 2Gb files for use with aircrack-ng on backtrack. it's a simple program I wrote because I'm learning c++.

TODO INCLUDES:
convert everything to classes

include more general functionality like

> choice to add zeros before every number

> auto split into 2 Gb files instead
> of the way I have it manually done
> Change to doubles-might make huge files though
